In this paper, we train and evaluate several localization methods on three different benchmark datasets, including Oxford RobotCar with over one million images.
This large scale evaluation yields valuable insights into
the generalizability and performance of retrieval-based
localization. Based on our findings, we develop a novel
method for learning more accurate and better generalizing localization features. It consists of two main
contributions: (i) a feature volume-based loss function,
and (ii) hard positive and pairwise negative mining.
