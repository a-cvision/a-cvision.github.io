We present a global and convex formulation for
template-less 3D reconstruction of a deforming object with
the perspective camera. We show for the first time how
to construct a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP)
problem for Non-Rigid Shape-from-Motion (NRSfM) using
the Maximum-Depth Heuristic (MDH). In this regard, we
deviate strongly from the general trend of using affine cameras and factorization-based methods to solve NRSfM. In
MDH, the points’ depths are maximized so that the distance
between neighbouring points in camera space are upper
bounded by the geodesic distance. In NRSfM both geodesic
and camera space distances are unknown. We show that,
nonetheless, given point correspondences and the camera’s
intrinsics the whole problem is convex and solvable with
SOCP.
