I"<p>In this paper we present
a method for incremental Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) with the
perspective camera model and the isometric surface prior with unknown focal
length. In the template-based case, we provide a method to estimate four parameters of the camera intrinsics. For the template-less scenario of NRSfM, we propose a method to upgrade reconstructions obtained for one focal length to another
based on local rigidity and the so-called Maximum Depth Heuristics (MDH). On
its basis we propose a method to simultaneously recover the focal length and the
non-rigid shapes. We further solve the problem of incorporating a large number of
points and adding more views in MDH-based NRSfM and efficiently solve them
with Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP).</p>
