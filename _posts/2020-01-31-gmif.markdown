In this work, we propose a method that learns image features targeted for image-retrieval-based localization. Retrieval-based localization has several benefits, such as easy maintenance and quick computation. However, the state-of-the-art features only provide visual similarity scores which do not explicitly reveal the geometric distance between query and retrieved images. Knowing this distance is highly desirable for accurate localization, especially when the reference images are sparsely distributed in the scene. Therefore, we propose a novel loss function for learning image features which are both visually representative and geometrically relatable.
