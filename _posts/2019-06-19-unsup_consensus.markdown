In this paper, we propose for the
first time an unsupervised learning framework for consensus maximization, in the context of solving 3D vision problems. For that purpose, we establish a relationship between inlier measurements, represented by an ideal of inlier set, and the subspace of polynomials representing the
space of target transformations. Using this relationship, we
derive a constraint that must be satisfied by the sought inlier set.
