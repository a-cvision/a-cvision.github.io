I"<p>We introduce a new GAN transfer method to explicitly propagate
the knowledge from the old classes to the new classes. The
key idea is to enforce the popularly used conditional batch
normalization (BN) to learn the class-specific information
of the new classes from that of the old classes, with implicit
knowledge sharing among the new ones. This allows for
an efficient knowledge propagation from the old classes to
the new ones, with the BN parameters increasing linearly
with the number of new classes.</p>
