This paper aims at learning semantic 3D keypoints across misaligned shapes in a category, in an unsupervised manner. In order to do so, we
model shapes defined by the keypoints, within a category, using the symmetric linear basis shapes without assuming the plane of symmetry to be
known. The plane of symmetry and the basis shapes are learned as weights of the network for a category, while the coefficients are predicted per shape instance.
