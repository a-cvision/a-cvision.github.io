I"—<p>In this paper, we propose a unified SfM method, in which the matching process is supported by self-calibration constraints. We use the idea that good matches should yield a valid calibration. In this process, we make use of the Dual Image of Absolute Quadric projection equations within a multiview correspondence framework, in order to obtain robust matching from a set of putative correspondences.</p>
