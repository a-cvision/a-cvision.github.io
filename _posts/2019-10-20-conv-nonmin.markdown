The proposed method exploits the well known Shor’s or
Lasserre’s relaxations, whose theoretical aspects are also
discussed. Notably, we further exploit the Polynomials Optimization Problems (POP) formulation
of non-minimal solver also for the generic consensus maximization problems in 3D vision. We support the proposed framework
by three diverse applications in 3D vision, namely rigid
body transformation estimation, Non-Rigid Structure-fromMotion (NRSfM), and camera autocalibration
