I"ù<p>The problem of localization often arises as part of a navigation process. In this paper we summarize
the reference images as a set of landmarks, which meet the
requirements for image-based navigation. A contribution
of this paper is to formulate such a set of requirements for
the two sub-tasks involved: compact map construction and
accurate self localization. These requirements are then exploited for compact map representation and accurate self-localization, using the framework of a network flow problem. During this process, we formulate the map construction and self-localization problems as convex quadratic and second-order cone programs, respectively.</p>
